Certainly is more correct in such cases to write data reading   more effectively - at least using scanf. But if the testing system   uses GNU C++ (checked on MinGW 4.4.1, but I think it works on other   versions too), and you don\u0027t want to rewrite input reading, it is   possible to improve performance by only one line placed in the   beginning of the program: \u003cspan style\u003d\"font-family: Courier New;font-size: 18.0px;\"\u003eios_base::sync_with_stdio(0)\u003cspan style\u003d\"font-family: Times New Roman;font-size: medium;\"\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv\u003e   \u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv\u003eOn my example where it was required to find the sum of one million   integers, it has accelerated the program in 4.5 times.
